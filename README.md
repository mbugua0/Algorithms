# Algorithms
1. Selection Sort:-
Using loop to select the smallest element from the unsorted portion of an array at each step and swapping to the front.

2. Linear Search:-
Using loop to traverse through the entire array to search for an element. 

3. Array Sum:- 
Given an array of integers, find the sum of its elements.

4. ArrayList element comparison:-
a[0]>b[0], so Alice receives  point.
a[0]=b[0], so nobody receives a point.
a[0]<b[0], so Bob receives  point.

5. Very Big Sum:- 
Calculate and print the sum of the elements in an array, keeping in mind that some of those integers may be quite large.
aVeryBigSum has the following parameter(s):
ar: an array of integers .
Input Format
The first line of the input consists of an integer .
The next line contains  space-separated integers contained in the array.
Output Format
Print the integer sum of the elements in the array.

6. Bubble Search:- We start at the front of the array and compare each pair of numbers. If they are out of order(ascending order), we swap them. Then, we move to the next pair and repeat the same process.This sorting algorithm is therefore called Bubble Sort because we continuously swap the largest element in the unsorted portion to the right until it is in its right position; the repetively swapping resembles the way bubbles rising to the surface.

7. Diagonal Difference:- Take a square matrix, calculate the absolute difference between the sums of its diagonals.

8. Merge Sort:- we recursively split and sort the left half and the right half of an array; once they are sorted, we combine them. It's faster but is memory intensive
