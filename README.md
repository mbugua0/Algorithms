# Algorithms
1. Selection Sort:-
Using loop to select the smallest element from the unsorted portion of an array at each step and swapping to the front.

2. Linear Search:-
Using loop to traverse through the entire array to search for an element. 

3. Array Sum:- 
Given an array of integers, find the sum of its elements.

4. ArrayList element comparison:-
a[0]>b[0], so Alice receives  point.
a[0]=b[0], so nobody receives a point.
a[0]<b[0], so Bob receives  point.
